        <p>If you want to get in to the world of ecommerce and ebusiness and <b>you want to sell goods and services on the Internet</b>, roughly speaking you have <b>two possible approaches</b>, primarily based on the fact who creates your website for online store and all the functionality for it and who is hosting your website.</p>

        <p>We will not talk too much about the second approach here which is also legitimate and efficient. It's much more complicated and requires a lot more time and investment. You need to be a programmer or you have to hire a web developer to create a website for you.The website must contain a large number of components and functionality.You have to worry about upgrading or maintaining software and about <b>web hosting for your site</b>.But if this is something you are interested in, or just have your own website, about anything else, be sure to check Bluehost.They are great and among the best when it comes to webhosting.</p>

        <button onclick="location.href='https://www.bluehost.com/'" type="button">Bluehost - Get Started</button>

        <p>The first, much simpler and more powerfull approach is Shopify software platform.What does Shopify say about Shopify?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Shopify is a complete commerce platform that lets you start, grow, and manage a business</li>
            <li><b>Shopify allows you to create and customize an online store</b></li>
            <li>Sell in multiple places, including web, mobile, social media, online marketplaces, brick-and-mortar locations, and pop-up shops</li>
            <li>Manage products, inventory, payments, and shipping</li>
            <li>Shopify is completely cloud-based and hosted, which means you don’t have to worry about upgrading or maintaining software or web servers. This gives you the flexibility to access and run your business from anywhere with an internet connection</li>
            <li><b>You don’t need to be a designer or developer to use Shopify</b></li>
            <li>Customize the look and feel of your store with the online store builder and themes</li>

            <li>You can use Shopify in nearly every country in the world</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you ask us for an opinion, Shopify has many advantages and top features.Some of them are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>quick and easy registration process</li>

                <p>When you finish creating and setting up your online store and when you are completely satisfied how it looks,on the end of trial period,you can choose one of the Shopify plans.We recommend the Basic Shopify plan, if you are just starting, and monthly payment option.<b>It is only 29/month USD$</b>.In this way you will reduce your initial costs and direct your money into marketing and some other things that are more important at the start.To send your store live, remove password from your store and start selling products you need to pick a plan.</p>

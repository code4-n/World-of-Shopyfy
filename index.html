        <p>If you want to get in to the world of ecommerce and ebusiness and <b>you want to sell goods and services on the Internet</b>, roughly speaking you have <b>two possible approaches</b>, primarily based on the fact who creates your website for online store and all the functionality for it and who is hosting your website.</p>
        <h4>Second approach-BlueHost webhosting for your online store</h4>

        <p>We will not talk too much about the second approach here (much more about this topic soon!) which is also legitimate and efficient. It's much more complicated and requires a lot more time and investment. You need to be a programmer or you have to hire a web developer to create a website for you.The website must contain a large number of components and functionality.You have to worry about upgrading or maintaining software and about <b>web hosting for your site</b>.But if this is something you are interested in, or just have your own website, about anything else, be sure to check Bluehost.They are great and among the best when it comes to webhosting.</p>

        <button onclick="location.href='https://www.bluehost.com/'" type="button">Bluehost - Get Started</button>
        <h4>First approach-Shopify online store</h4>

        <p>The first, much simpler and more powerfull approach is Shopify software platform.What does Shopify say about Shopify?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Shopify is a complete commerce platform that lets you start, grow, and manage a business</li>
            <li><b>Shopify allows you to create and customize an online store</b></li>
            <li>Sell in multiple places, including web, mobile, social media, online marketplaces, brick-and-mortar locations, and pop-up shops</li>
            <li>Manage products, inventory, payments, and shipping</li>
            <li>Shopify is completely cloud-based and hosted, which means you don’t have to worry about upgrading or maintaining software or web servers. This gives you the flexibility to access and run your business from anywhere with an internet connection</li>
            <li><b>You don’t need to be a designer or developer to use Shopify</b></li>
            <li>Customize the look and feel of your store with the online store builder and themes</li>
            <li>Add features and functionality to your store with apps from Shopify App Store</li>
            <li>You can use Shopify in nearly every country in the world</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you ask us for an opinion, Shopify has many advantages and top features.Some of them are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>quick and easy registration process</li>
            <li>excellent customer support</li>
            <li>shopify platform is extremely user friendly and easy to operate</li>
            <li>planty of features</li>
            <li>help in marketing and seo(search engine optimization)</li>
            <li>beautiful design</li>
            <li>speed and security for hosting</li>
            <li>add-ons (Shopify App Store + Buy Button)</li>
            <li>pricing plan variants depending on scale of your business</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Analyze and explore everything we've said in the next section.There we will show you all the basic steps in creating and customizing an Shopify online store, from registration(sign up) to sending your store live, with the help of detailed and proven video tutorials.Store creating process is simple, transparent and intuitive.We recommend that you <a href="https://www.shopify.com/pricing" target="_blank">GET THE FREE 14-DAY SHOPIFY TRIAL</a><b>(no credit card required)</b>, and work on your online store step by step alongside us.The best way is to play video tutorial in one tab of an internet browser, and create your Shopify store in another tab.Pause tutorial when needed.This way you will get your first online store quickly.Simply try Shopify first and then, if you like what you see, pick the plan that best fits into your business model, when the trial period is over.</p>

        <p>In the text above, we promised that we will try to be simple in our explanations and precise.By definition,ecommerce, also known as electronic commerce or internet commerce, refers to the <b>buying and selling of goods or services using the internet</b>, and the transfer of money and data to execute these transactions.So, if you are an entrepreneur, if you have an idea and if you want to sell goods and services on the Internet, roughly speaking you have two possible approaches.The first and more powerfull approach is Shopify software platform.In this case, everything you need is provided by Shopify.You need a valid email address to register. The registration is short and clear and you do not need a credit card when registering.You start with 14 days free trial(sometimes you can get an extension from the customer service).
        Your personal dashboard is transparent and easy to use. In a few simple steps, you can adjust how your store will look. You can use free themes if you do not want those that are being paid.Now,you already have an online store.It's very easy to add products. You are adding pictures, product names, and descriptions of your products.You add product prices and details related to shipping. All in a few clicks and without the ability to make a mistake.Finally, you choose how your customers will pay you.Of course, there are some other fine details here, but roughly that is it. From the registration to the opening of your store, if you are a little more skilled, it does not have to pass more than an hour and you do not need to know anything about programming.</p>
        
        <p>Sign up with Shopify and start creating your store now with <b>14-day FREE TRIAL!</b>Pick your plan later, <b>no credit card required!</b>Everything you need is a little free time and one valid email address.</p>
